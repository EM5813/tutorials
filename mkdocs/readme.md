# What is MkDocs?

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is static page generator written in Python with focus on documentation. The source files are in Markdown format. It has very good support of [plugins](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) and extensions (thanks to [python-markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/)). It is easy to start with and building the site is straightforward. It has build-in web server to serve the site and automatically detect changes and autoreloads the page. There are build-in themes and plenty of good [third party themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes).
